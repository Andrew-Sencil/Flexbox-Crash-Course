FlexBox notes

â€¢Flexible Box Model is a one dimensional layout model that provides a method to offer space distribution and powerful alignment capabilities.

-Before Flexbox, we aligned elements using floats and tables. Flexbox has made life mush easier for people that use CSS.
-CSS Grid is another option for alignment, positioning, etc. It's good to learn both.
-The flex container is the element that holds flex items. Flex items are direct children of flex containers. A container is created with display: flex

Ex:
<div>
	<div>Flex Item 1</div>
	<div>Flex Item 2</div>
	<img src="pic.png" alt="also a flex item"/>
</div>
